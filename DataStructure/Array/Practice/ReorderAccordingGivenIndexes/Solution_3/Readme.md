In this solution, I will use one temponary list to store the order of element with their truth index.
temp[index[i]] = a[i] (which i is the index we use to traversal linear the list)
So that, we take O(n) with time and O(n) with space. Because, we traversal list from begin to end one times and do not use nested loop and we use a temponary list to store the truth value - truth positions of the value.
