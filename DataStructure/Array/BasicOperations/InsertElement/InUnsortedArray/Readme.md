1. Insert at the end:
In an unsorted array, the insert operation is faster as compared to a sorted array because we donâ€™t have to care about the position at which the element is to be placed.
Time Complexity: O(1) 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Insert at any position
Insert operation in an array at any position can be performed by shifting elements to the right, which are on the right side of the required position
Time complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
