Problem: Max and min element in Binary Tree

Given a Binary Tree, find maximum and minimum elements in it.

Example
Input: 
         6
        / \
       5   8
      /
     2
Output: 8 2

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete findMax() and findMin() functions which take root node of the tree as input parameter and return the maximum and minimum elements in the binary tree respectively.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 10^5
1 <= Data of a node <= 10^5
