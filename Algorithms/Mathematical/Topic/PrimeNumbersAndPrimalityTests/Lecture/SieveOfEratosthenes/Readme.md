Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number. 

Example: 
Input : n =10
Output : 2 3 5 7 
Input : n = 20 
Output: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so

Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by the Eratostheneâ€™s method: 
When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime.

Explanation with Example: 
Let us take an example when n = 100. So, we need to print all prime numbers smaller than or equal to 100. 
We create a list of all numbers from 2 to 100.

The classical Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm takes O(N log (log N)) time
