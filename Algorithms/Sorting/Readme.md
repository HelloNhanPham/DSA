In this topic, I will introduce to viewers many interesting SORTING algorithms and some theoty about them include implement, comparison between them, their advantage in programming and some practical applications, ... in our live and in the programming path.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are some algorithms I will introduce to you:
    1/ Selection Sort
    2/ Bubble Sort
